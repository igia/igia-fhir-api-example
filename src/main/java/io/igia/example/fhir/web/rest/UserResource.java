/**
 * REST controller for managing users.
 * <p>
 * This class accesses the User entity, and needs to fetch its collection of authorities.
 * <p>
 * For a normal use-case, it would be better to have an eager relationship between User and Authority,
 * and send everything to the client side: there would be no View Model and DTO, a lot less code, and an outer-join
 * which would be good for performance.
 * <p>
 * We use a View Model and a DTO for 3 reasons:
 * <ul>
 * <li>We want to keep a lazy association between the user and the authorities, because people will
 * quite often do relationships with the user, and we don't want them to get the authorities all
 * the time for nothing (for performance reasons). This is the #1 goal: we should not impact our users'
 * application because of this use-case.</li>
 * <li> Not having an outer join causes n+1 requests to the database. This is not a real issue as
 * we have by default a second-level cache. This means on the first HTTP call we do the n+1 requests,
 * but then all authorities come from the cache, so in fact it's much better than doing an outer join
 * (which will get lots of data from the database, for each HTTP call).</li>
 * <li> As this manages users, for security reasons, we'd rather have a DTO layer.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Another option would be to have a specific JPA entity graph to handle this case.
